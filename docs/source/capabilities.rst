Capabilities
============

SymCalc is built on the top of the SymPy library, which provides all of the mathematical machinery behind SymCalc. All expressions and operations are eventually converted to one that SymPy can understand. The SymPy project can be found on their `website <https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_ and their `GitHub <https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_.

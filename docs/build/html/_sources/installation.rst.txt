Installation
============

This repository makes use of abstract syntax trees, which are version-specific features of Python. Because of this, the calculator is only tested to work on Python 3.10, and is unlikely to work in previous versions. Please update Python to the latest version. This package is not yet published on PyPI. 

Installation is not required to use the calculator. Simply clone this repository and run ``interact.py`` to get started.

Installation is required to import the calculator into other programs. Review and run the ``install.py`` script to install.

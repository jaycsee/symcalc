# ðŸ–© SymCalc

SymCalc is a symbolic calculator built purely in Python on top of the SymPy library, providing natural math input and ease of use while preserving the versatility of Python. It is an offline alternative to [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) and [SymPy Gamma](https://gamma.sympy.org/), and can easily be modified for any specific use case.

## Documentation

Documentation is built with Sphinx and can be found at `docs/build/html/index.html`. The contents are not yet hosted online, but can be opened by a browser.

## Installation

Installation is not required to use the calculator. Simply clone this repository and run `interact.py` to get started. If you wish to install the package to create your own applications, review and run the `install.py` script. This package is not available on PyPI.

## Getting Started

SymCalc is built on SymPy, so anything available in SymPy is available as well. Running `interact.py` enables the default environment, which accepts and understands natural math input. For examples, see the documentation in the repository or the SymPy documentation.
